        <p>
            Many trips around the sun ago, I learned about the code that holds together the virtual-reality that society obsesses over.
            <br/><br/>
            Despite since spending countless hours maintaining the cluttered back-alleys that serve the DOMs and HTTP requests, I had never enacted upon my youthful desire to have a corner of the Internet that I could call truly my own.
            <br/><br/>
            This website aims to fulfil that naive desire.
            <br/><br/>
            As such there are some desires I have for this site:
            <br/>
            <ol>
                <li>This site will be light-weight, low-fuss, and low-tech, with a focus on functionality overall.</li>
                <li>This site will rely as little as it can on external service providers, for the sake of DIY attitude and learning experience.</li>
                <li>This site will be in a constant state of flux, as is the individual behind it.</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
            Much like myself, this site not yet knows what it is.
            <br/>
            It will gradually find it's way.
